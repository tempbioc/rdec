Title: rdec -- regression with damped exponential correlation
Description: The rdec function uses generalized least squares to estimate
	covariate effects in the presence of a structured correlation
	matrix intended for longitudinal responses.  The within-cluster
	correlation has a damped exponential form: if |s| is distance
	between two observations in a cluster, the correlation between
	them has form g^(|s|^t) where g and t are parameters to be
	estimated by maximum likelihood, assuming residuals are Gaussian.
	t == 0 implies a compound symmetry or exchangeable correlation,
	t == 1 implies a first-order autoregression, and large t implies
	a first-order moving average model.
